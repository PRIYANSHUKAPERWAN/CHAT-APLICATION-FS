Test the app (quick)

Start backend: node server.js (port 5000)

Start frontend: npm start (port 3000)

Open http://localhost:3000 in one browser window — enter a name and Join.

Open another tab or different browser and join with a different name.

Send messages — both windows should instantly show all messages (including system join/leave messages). No refresh required.

Notes & small improvements you can add

Persist messages on server (in-memory or DB) so new joiners can see history.

Add list of connected users and display it (emit userList from server).

Support multiple rooms (namespaces or socket.join(room)).

Add timestamps formatted nicely (e.g., toLocaleString() or moment).

Add typing indicators: socket.on('typing') + broadcast.
